📊 Data Preprocessing Blog Series
Welcome to the Data Preprocessing Blog Series, where we explore the essential steps needed to prepare raw data for successful Machine Learning and Data Science projects.

This repository contains supporting Jupyter notebooks, datasets, and visualizations that accompany the blog series published on Medium and maintained here on GitHub.

✍️ Blog Series Overview
Each part in this blog series covers a critical phase in the data preprocessing pipeline, using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.

🔢 Part	🧩 Topic	📌 Description
🔹 Part 1	Data Collection	Introduction to collecting relevant and high-quality datasets.
🔹 Part 2	Data Cleaning	Handling missing values, outliers, and duplicate records.
🔹 Part 3	Data Transformation	Encoding, binning, and log transformations for better modeling.
🔹 Part 4	Feature Scaling	Standardization, Min-Max Scaling, and Robust Scaling techniques.
🔹 Part 5	Feature Engineering	Creating new features and selecting the most impactful ones.
🔹 Part 6	EDA & Visualization	Visualizing patterns and summaries using plots (optional)
